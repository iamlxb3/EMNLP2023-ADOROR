## Overview

This repository contains the code for the ADOROR method, where we plan to open source all the code with detailed
comments if the paper is accepted

### Code for the core steps

- prepare_O.py: Code for Algorithm 1, how the data set O is constructed
- demp_graph.py: Code for Algorithm 2, how we conduct ensemble inference on the optimal subgraph
- demo_selector_vanilla_transformer.py: The model structure for f selector with vanilla transformer encoder
- demo_selector_rel_pos.py: The model structure for f selector with transformer encoder of relation position attention
