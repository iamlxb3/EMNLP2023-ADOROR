## Overview

Part of the code for the ADORER method, we will open source all the code with detailed comments if the paper is
accepted.

### Code for the core steps

- prepare_O.py: Code for Algorithm 1, how the data set O is constructed
- demp_graph.py: Code for Algorithm 2, how we conduct ensemble on the optimal subgraph
- demo_selector_vanilla_transformer.py: The model structure for f selector with vanilla transformer encoder
- demo_selector_rel_pos.py: The model structure for f selector with transformer encoder of relation position attention
